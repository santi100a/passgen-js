# Random Password Generator in JavaScript

This is a password generator that generates random passwords.
The resulting passwords don't make any sense, but they are random
(and thus, **very** secure).
You can specify a **lot** of different parameters to modify the
way the program generates passwords in the settings.jsonc file.
